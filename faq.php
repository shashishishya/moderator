                    without leaving his/her home a volunteer can help a blind student, by using skype call 
                    and a distant student can benefit a lot.  
                    Time and energy are saved, as there is no need to travel for either of them.

                 The mother tongue of the blind may be Kannnada, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, etc. 
                 Hence, volunteers who have one of the languages as their own language, or 
                 proficient in more than one language will be very valuable to these students, 
                 as they can communicate and explain certain concepts in the mother tongue of the student. 
                 Many students choose English as the medium of studies in the college level.  
                 Text books, reference books are all in English. 
                 A volunteer with good English language background can be of immense help, 
                 in making them understand the terms and concepts and also in improving their English language skill. </div>

                 Volunteers can go beyond giving help in academics.  
                 Students get the opportunity to meet and interact many volunteers with different skills.  
                 The bond between the volunteers and the students, lead to a positive impact on the students. 
                 The volunteers get to know the world of blind and put in efforts to light their path 
                 and the students get to know more about the outside world. 
                 Many volunteers can provide good exposure to the students in many fields, such as, 
                 what is happening in the world of science, politics, finance, international relations, etc.  
                 and encourage them to form their own opinion regarding various aspects of life.

                 That could be any place, home of the candidate/volunteers,

                 libraries, hospitals, clubs, worshipping place (temple/ special  groups). 
                 Any place suitable and convenient, trustworthy for both the candidate and the volunteer.  
                 Once, the heads of these various institutions are convinced that the requirement is for a valuable purpose, 
                 there wonâ€™t be any hurdle. The scribe volunteer will meet the candidate in the exam hall. 
                 For audio recording of the books, scanning text book, they do not need to meet each other. 
                 Distance service also can be done on skype from home. </div>
